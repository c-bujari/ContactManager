## A simple online contact manager

This project was originally a team effort, and I can't take the credit for it without acknowledging my group members. The project is kept in its original state at https://github.com/COP4331C/ContactManager, where you can also see who worked on it.

This fork will be my attempt to update certain parts of the project as I try to host it in a more permanent manner - the original project had some security issues that need to be fixed before this is possible.
